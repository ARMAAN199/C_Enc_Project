# **Project Description**
___
This project is for **securing** certain **files** in a user's system according to different passcodes that the user creates. 

You can make different passwords and map them to different files so that only a specific collection of files are accessible that are mapped to that particular passcode.



# Goals
> Targets to achieve
___
* Implement Caeser-Cipher Encryption on files
* Achieve secure user Authentication
* Add other layers of security on files like:
  * Move locked files to another location. So that they are not visible at the original location and even if someone reaches the new location. They won't be able to access the content as the file would be encrypted.
  * Auto logout all users on program startup.


# Specifications
> What each file does
___
* Users folder contains the data of all users.
* I'll Add details of other files as the project goes on.


# Design
> Logic behind stuff
